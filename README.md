Business Objective: To build a machine learning model for early detection of stroke risk in patients, leading to timely intervention and improved healthcare outcomes.

Approach: Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand data distribution and correlations, preprocess data by handling missing values, encode categorical variables, and balance dataset using SMOTE. Evaluate multiple classification models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

Tools and Techniques Used: Python programming, pandas, numpy for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization, scikit-learn for machine learning models and techniques, including logistic regression, ensemble methods, and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
